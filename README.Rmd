[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/campfin)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=campfin)

## Overview

The `campfin` package was created to facilitate the work being done by 
[The Accountability Project][01], a tool created by [The Investigative Reporting Workshop][02]. The
Accountability Project curates, cleans and indexes public data to give journalists, researchers and
others a simple way to search across otherwise siloed records. The data focuses on people,
organizations and locations. This package was created specifically to helo with state-level
**camp**aign **fin**ance data.

## Installation

The package is not on CRAN and must be installed from GitHub.

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kiernann/campfin")
```

## Functions

The most important functions are the in the `normal_*()` family. These functions take geographic
data and return [normalized text][03] that is more searchable. They are largely wrappers around
the [`stringr` package][07].

* `normal_zip()` takes [ZIP Codes][04] and returns a 5 digit character string
* `normal_state()` takes US states and returns a [2 digit abbreviation][05]
* `normal_address()` takes a _street_ address and reduces inconsistencies
* `normal_city()` takes cities and reduces inconsistencies (to help with [cluster and merging][06])

[07]: https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr "stringr"

There are other functions which help load, explore, and process campaign finance data:

* `all_files_new()` checks if all files in a directory have been recently downloaded
* `glimpse_fun()` applies a function (like `dplyr::n_distinct()`) to every column in a data frame
* `prop_in(x, y)` (and `prop_out()`) wraps around `mean(x %in% y)`
* `count_na(x)` wraps around `sum(is.na(x))`

More functions will be added over time to automate even more of the wrangling workflow.

## Data

The package also contains the `geo` [tibble][08], a normalized version of the `zipcodes` data frame
from the [`zipcodes`][09] R package, which itself is a version of the 
[CivicSpace US ZIP Code Database][10].

[09]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zipcode/ "zip_pkg"
[10]: https://boutell.com/zipcodes/ "civic_space"

```{r geo_df, collapse=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(campfin)
library(zipcode)

data("zipcode")
sample_n(zipcode, 10)

# normal cities in a better order
sample_n(campfin::geo, 10)

# more US states than the built in state.abb
setdiff(geo$state, datasets::state.abb)
```

The package also contains a useful list of common invalid values.

```{r na_city}
sample(campfin::na_city, 10)
```

## Example

In this example, we can see how the `normal_*()` functions turn messy data into a single format.

```{r tribble, echo=FALSE}
library(tibble)
library(knitr)

vt <- tribble(
  ~address,             ~city,          ~state,    ~zip,
  "744 Cape Cod Rd.",    "Stowe, VT",    "VT",      "05672-5563",
  "N/A",                "N/A",          "N/A",     "N/A",
  "149_Church_Street",  "Burlington",   "Vermont", "05401", 
  "51 depot   square",  "st johnsbury", "vt",      "5819",
  "XXXXXXX",            "UNKNOWN",      "XX",      "00000"
)
kable(vt, )
```

```{r normalize}
vt_na <- c("", "NA", "UNKNOWN")
vt2 <- vt %>% mutate(
  address = normal_address(
    address = address,
    add_abbs = tibble(abb = "RD", rep = "ROAD"), 
    na = vt_na,
    na_rep = TRUE
  ),
  city = normal_city(
    city = city,
    geo_abbs = tibble(abb = "ST", rep = "SAINT"),
    st_abbs = c("VT"),
    na = vt_na,
    na_rep = TRUE
  ),
  state = normal_state(
    state = state,
    abbreviate = TRUE,
    na = ,
    na_rep = TRUE,
    valid = state.abb
  ),
  zip = normal_zip(
    zip = zip,
    na = vt_na,
    na_rep = TRUE
  )
)
```

```{r kable_normal, echo=FALSE}
kable(vt2)
```
